<p>Since the very beginning I was in a team which created web browsers for iOS. Currently Opera has two web browsers for iOS. At the beginning I was a part of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/opera-coast-web-browser/id674024845?mt=8">Opera Coast</a> team. Later I was working on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/pl/app/opera-mini-web-browser/id363729560?mt=8">Opera for iOS</a>.</p>

<p>Though my job title was "Quality Assurance Engineer" I also had responsibilities as an iOS developer, so I did some programming in Swift, Objective-C too. Of course a vast majority of my daily tasks were still related to writing automation tests in Swift, Python and Objective-C as well as other forms of testing.</p>

<p>Thanks to that I have very long experience strictly related to iOS development and very good knowledge of Swift.</p>

<p>My main responsibilites were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writing automation tests using Swift and Python as a part of Continuous Integration system.</li>
  <li>Implementing new features for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/pl/app/opera-mini-web-browser/id363729560?mt=8">Opera for iOS</a> in Swift.</li>
  <li>Continuous Integration and manual tests planning, preparing and management.</li>
  <li>Writing and executing test cases both automated and manual.</li>
  <li>Integration, regresson, functional and system testing.</li>
  <li>Checking crash report systems and feedbacks from our customers to find new issues, regressions and change requests.</li>
  <li>Cooperation with developers and QAs from different countries.</li>
</ul>

<h6>July 2012 - February 2014</h6>
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 4px;">Test Consultant</h3>
<h6 style="margin-bottom: 18px;"><a href="http://volvoit.com">Volvo IT</a> / Mydlana 2, 51-502 Wrocław</h6>

<p>I was working in a project which consists of multiple desktop applications, servers and internet platform to put embedded systems into trucks and buses. Those applications are also used to manage stations and servers in factories. All parts of the system are designed and created only for Windows.</p>

<p>I was responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writing automation scripts to test all components of the infrastructure.</li>
  <li>Preparing, creating and executing test cases both manual and automated.</li>
  <li>Integration, regression, functional and system testing.</li>
  <li>Work in SCRUM and Kanban methodologies.</li>
  <li>Cooperation with developers and analysts from different countries.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interests</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Books (usually non-fiction ones).</li>
  <li>Motorcycles. I ride <a href="https://cdn.yamaha-motor.eu/design-cafe/2007/2007_FZ6-S2_abs_Midnight%20Black%20(SMX)_PS%2007.jpg">Yamaha FZ6 (2007)</a>.</li>
