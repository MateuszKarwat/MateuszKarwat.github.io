Hi!  
I'm Mateusz Karwat and I live in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland.

I'm a developer though I currently work as a Quality Assurance Engineer in [Opera][1]. Nevertheless, I'm in love with [Swift][2] and lately I put all my effort in this language and platforms related with it.

To see what I've published so far you can visit my [Github profile][3]. To find out more about my professional experience you can go to [this page][4] or visit my [LinkedIn profile][5].

If you find mistakes in this site, don't hesitate to make a pull request on [the Github repository][6].

If you have any questions or you just want to talk, feel free to contact me: mateuszkarwat at gmail.com.
